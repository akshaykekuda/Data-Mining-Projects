Worked on the below projects during the DataMining Course:
1. Performed exploratory data analysis and visualization of the Marvel and DC comic dataset to identify gender bias aspects in the
comic book industry.
2. Compared the performance of classifiers like logistic regressor, k-NN, Decision Tree, Na√Øve Bayes, SVMs and Ensemble classifier
on the Social Network Ads Dataset. Also compared the performance of these classifiers with hyperparameter tuning on the Bank
Customer Turnover dataset.
3. Association Rule Mining on the Online Retail Dataset
4. Unsupervised and Supervised cluster evaluation of the Seeds Dataset
